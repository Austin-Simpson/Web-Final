# Ab's Restaurant Finder

## Description
Our full stack app is based on a restaurant finder that takes a user’s location and desired cuisine. Using Yelp’s API, the application outputs a list of restaurants in the nearby area, with relevant information such as an image and rating of the restaurant, the number of reviews, distance, and phone number. If there is no specific cuisine the user desires, the user can leave the search box empty and the application will output any restaurant.

Upon clicking on the Yelp icon, the user is redirected to the restaurant’s yelp page for further view. Additionally, the Google Maps icon redirects the user to the google maps application and inputs the direction from the location.
